# ITAssessmentSystem
The ASP.NET MVC based web application aims at automating the traditional approach of assessing students using excel sheets.
This application makes use of SQL Server and saves all the templates for assessment and the results submitted by the Instructors. 
Once data is entered on the database, different queries can be used to calculate the trend and performace of the students and also the Instructor.

The application uses Entity Framework, an Object Relational Modelling approach for creating a layer betweein the server and the database.
The application makes use of stored procedures for queries. The use of javascript and jquery is very less considering the scenario if the javascript is disabled in the browser.
The application compromises of different technologies like ASP.NET MVC framework, Entity Framework, PJAX for quick page loading, JQuery and Boostrap CSS.
